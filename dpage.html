<h1>Regulation as a Platform</h1>
<h2>Anyone can register to access Regulation as a Platform using the account registration process below. </h2>
<h2>This is a great opportunity to test out and influence the development of this prototype technology to maximise its capability and potential utility. </h2>
<h2> Your contact details will be used for statistical purposes to help evaluate platform utility and use, and to provide you with development and progress updates: including when new rule sets are available. </h2>
<h2>Regulation available on the platform has no official status as law. As part of the registration process you will be required to acknowledge that use of the prototype platform is for test purposes only and not real-world applications. </h2>
<h2>This proof-of-concept project is supported by the National Innovation and Science Agenda: platforms for open data. </h2>
<h2> Regulation is a key data set of governments, and the project aims to demonstrate how a public platform of digital rules, capable of being cost-effectively maintained by government, can be leveraged by anyone to build test applications to help reduce the cost and time required to understand, navigate and comply with regulation for the benefit of businesses and citizens. </h2>
